This project showcases my expertise in analyzing astronomical FITS data, combining technical skills with a passion for space exploration. I developed a comprehensive pipeline to detect, classify, and visualize celestial objects, leveraging techniques like intensity thresholding, connected-component labeling, and feature extraction. The system identifies objects such as stars, galaxies, and planets, calculates attributes like size, position, and luminosity, and classifies them using customizable criteria. Outputs include detailed results in CSV format and intuitive visualizations, ensuring both accuracy and accessibility. Advanced methods, such as Niblack’s local thresholding, enhance robustness under varying intensity conditions.
Interning at ISRO VSSC excites me profoundly, as it offers the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking space missions like Chandrayaan and Aditya-L1 while working with some of the brightest minds in the field. My project reflects the skills and dedication I bring to this internship—proficiency in data analysis, image processing, and scientific problem-solving.
This internship aligns with my aspiration to combine astrophysics and technology to tackle real-world challenges in space exploration. I am eager to contribute meaningfully to ISRO’s projects, learn from its esteemed team, and further develop my expertise. Joining ISRO VSSC would be a dream come true and a milestone in my journey toward advancing space research.I look forward to contributing meaningfully and learning extensively.

This project focuses on analyzing astronomical FITS data to detect and classify celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and planets. Using advanced image processing techniques, it processes raw telescope data to identify regions of interest, extract meaningful features, and classify objects based on their physical attributes. The pipeline incorporates methods like thresholding for object detection, connected-component labeling for segmentation, and feature extraction to calculate properties like size, position, and luminosity. Results are outputted in a CSV format for further analysis, with accompanying visualizations to validate object detection and classification. Robust methods, such as Niblack’s thresholding, ensure adaptability to varying intensity distributions, making it suitable for diverse datasets.
